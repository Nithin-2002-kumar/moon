Project: Multimodal Omniscient Operational Network (MOON Assistant)

Description:
Designed and developed MOON, an intelligent voice assistant powered by a Multimodal Omniscient Operational Network, integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Recognition, Computer Vision, and Multi-Agent Systems. MOON is built to operate across voice, text, and visual modalities, enabling seamless human-AI interaction for real-world task execution.

Key Features & Technologies:

🎙️ Voice Interaction Engine with wake-word detection (“Hey MOON”)

🌐 Multimodal Input Support: Speech, Text, Facial Expressions, and Gestures

🧠 Utility-Based + Learning Agents for decision-making and continuous improvement

📸 Real-time Computer Vision: Facial recognition, emotion detection, hand gestures (MediaPipe + OpenCV)

🌍 Multilingual Support via Google Translate API + SpaCy

🖥️ GUI Dashboard (Tkinter) for task control, analytics, and user settings

Impact:
Enabled an intelligent, multimodal assistant deployable on desktop and mobile, capable of performing smart actions, responding to commands in multiple languages, and adapting to user behavior through reinforcement learning.
